<p>Named after "The Palm," an apartment on Palmetto Street, the Palm Sundays Fantasy Football League was founded in 2022 in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p>Each member has a different connection to the league — some go back decades, while others didn’t know one another until the group chat was started. However, the friendships formed in this league have only strengthened since then. Members constantly support one another, bonding beyond the league in ways that inspire belief in the power of human connection.</p>
<p>The league is a PPR, superflex league. Traditionally, it has followed a snake draft format, with draft order determined by a NASCAR race held prior to the draft. New for the 2025 season, the league has switched from priority waivers to a Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB) system. For the first two seasons, every team made the playoffs. In the 2024 season, however, only the top 8 teams advanced, while the bottom 4 were banished to the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>Past champions include: Jake Routh, Josh Seigel, and Ryan Cox.</p>
<p>Past losers include: Oliver Stabley, Ethan Davis, and Ethan Davis.</p>
