<p>This site is mostly a result of me breaking my arm and the boredom that came with it. I used to make free websites when I was younger
 that were just full of random pictures from Google Images and had tons of flashgames, so I thought it would be cool to actually make one
 from scratch</p>
<p>I started DJing at WCBN in the fall of 2019, and started my regular show in January 2020.</p>
<p>I don't really know why the show is called what it is. I heard a friend say it when working on a project, and for some reason it just
 struck me as being a good name for a show. Y vs. X!</p>
<p>I'm sure I could come up with some deep explanation of how it connects to the show, but there really isn't anything there</p>
<p>But that's about it, hope you enjoy</p>
