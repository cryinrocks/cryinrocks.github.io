<p>Named after "The Palm", an appartment on Palmetto Street, the Palm Sundays Fantasy Football League was founded in 2022 in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
<p>Each member has a different conenction to the league, with some going back decades, and some not knowing one anoter until the group chat was started. However, the friendhsips formed in this league have only strenghted since then. Members conastantly support one another, connecting beyond the league in ways that inspire belief in the power of human conenction.</p>
<p> The leagus is a PPR, superflex league. Traditionally, the league has been a snake draft, with draft order being determined through a Nascar race prior to the draft. New for the 2025 season, the league has switched from priority waivers to Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB). For the first two seasons, each and every team made the playoffs. For the 2024 season, however, the top 8 teams made the playoffs, while the bottom 4 were banished to the toilet bowl.</p>
<p>Past champions include: Jake Routh, Josh Seigel, and Ryan Cox.</p>
<P>Past losers include: Oliver Stabley, Ethan Davis, and Ethan Davis.</P>
