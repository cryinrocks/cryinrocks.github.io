    <h2>Team Name 1</h2>
    <p>A truly unique franchise, the Blue Collars are the only team to change ownership in league history. Originally founded by a great, great man in Dylan Boyd (#NeverForget) the Blue Collars franchise will #AlwaysRemember our original owner. However, make no mistake - the franchise needed new leadership. Championship caliber leadership.
    So damn it, that is exactly what the franchise brought in. Initially, Mr. Routh refused to be a founding member of this league due to his outstanding duties as Commissioner and Owner across many leagues. BUT, his championship pedigree made him the obvious choice to step in and he couldn’t ignore the pleading and begging of the Blue Collar’s massive fanbase.
    Despite not drafting the team and beginning his reign with an 0-6 record. Mr. Routh made massive moves, immediately putting the Blue Collars firmly on the map. It wasn’t long before the Blue Collars were celebrated as the inaugural champions of the illustrious Palm Sundays Fantasy Football League.
    After the incredible, meteoric rise of the Blue Collars, you may be asking - what now? What now? What... now? To that the Blue Collars say: More. Fucking. Rings.
